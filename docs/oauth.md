# OAuth 2.1 for MCP Clients

Scrumboy's canonical MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint, `/mcp/rpc`, supports OAuth 2.1 for clients that implement automatic discovery, PKCE, and Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) — for example Cursor and Claude Code. `/mcp/rpc` is the sole OAuth protected resource. The separate `/mcp` endpoint remains Scrumboy's legacy bootstrap/tool API and accepts session cookies or static `sb_…` API tokens, never OAuth access tokens. **No environment variables are required for a direct-TLS or loopback/localhost deployment.** When `SCRUMBOY_TRUST_PROXY=1`, OAuth issuer discovery requires either `SCRUMBOY_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` or a proxy-provided `X-Forwarded-Host` together with a forwarded HTTPS indication. See [Issuer / discovery origin](#issuer--discovery-origin) below.

Compatible clients: any MCP client that speaks HTTP OAuth discovery (RFC 8414 / RFC 9728), PKCE (RFC 7636, S256 only), Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591), and OAuth resource indicators. Cursor and Claude Code are the live-acceptance targets; other compatible MCP-over-HTTP clients use the same protocol.

---

## Quick Start

Point a native MCP client directly at `/mcp/rpc`:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http scrumboy https://scrumboy.example.com/mcp/rpc
```

The client will:

1. Receive `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://scrumboy.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp/rpc"` from the protected transport, then fetch that document and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.
2. `POST /oauth/register` to self-register as a public client (no `client_secret`).
3. Open a browser to `/oauth/authorize` with a PKCE `code_challenge`.
4. Prompt you to log in (if not already) and approve access.
5. Exchange the returned code for an access token at `/oauth/token`.

Static Bearer API tokens (`docs/mcp.md`) remain fully supported and unaffected — this is an additional way to obtain a Bearer credential, not a replacement.

---

## How It Works

1. MCP client discovers endpoints via the challenged `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp/rpc` document and `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`. The root protected-resource endpoint remains a compatibility fallback and describes the same `/mcp/rpc` resource.
2. Client registers itself via `POST /oauth/register` (RFC 7591) and receives a `client_id` (no secret — public client).
3. Client redirects the user's browser to `GET /oauth/authorize` with `response_type=code`, its `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, a PKCE `code_challenge` (S256), and exactly one `resource=https://scrumboy.example.com/mcp/rpc` parameter.
4. If the user has no active Scrumboy session, the authorization page offers the configured sign-in methods: local password, SSO, or both. Successful sign-in returns to the pending authorization request and shows consent ("Approve access for `<client name>`?").
5. On approval, Scrumboy redirects back to the client's `redirect_uri` with a single-use authorization code.
6. Client exchanges the code (plus its `code_verifier`) for an access token and refresh token at `POST /oauth/token`, repeating the same `resource` value. Refresh requests also include `client_id` and the canonical `resource`.
7. Client sends the opaque Scrumboy access token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` only to `/mcp/rpc`.

## Requirements & Constraints

**Client type**

- Public clients only (no `client_secret`, `token_endpoint_auth_method: "none"`). This matches how Claude Code and most MCP clients register.
- One `redirect_uri` per client, fixed at registration time.

**PKCE**

- Required on every authorization request. Only `S256` is accepted; `plain` is rejected.

**Protected resource binding**

- Authorization and token requests require exactly one absolute `resource` URI identifying `<trusted-public-origin>/mcp/rpc`; missing, duplicate, malformed, or different values fail with `invalid_target`.
- Scheme and hostname case are accepted case-insensitively for interoperability. Path, port, escaping, query, fragment, and trailing-slash semantics are not normalized. The path must be exactly `/mcp/rpc`.
- Authorization codes, access tokens, and refresh tokens persist the canonical resource. Code and refresh redemption validate client, redirect URI, PKCE, and resource before the artifact is consumed, and consume/revoke plus access/refresh token insertion run in a single database transaction so a failed issue does not leave a spent grant without tokens.
- `/mcp/rpc` accepts only Scrumboy's own opaque OAuth access tokens bound to its current canonical resource. Upstream OIDC-provider tokens are not MCP credentials. OAuth artifacts issued before resource binding are invalidated during migration and require one reauthorization; DCR client registrations remain usable.

**Authentication / OIDC continuation**

- Initial instance ownership is still established through the main app: while Scrumboy has zero users, OAuth authorization shows **Set up Scrumboy first** and does not start SSO. After that one-time bootstrap, the configured login modes below apply.
- An existing Scrumboy session skips the login page and goes directly to consent.
- Without OIDC, the authorization page keeps the local email/password form. With OIDC and local auth both enabled, it shows the password form and **Continue with SSO** as explicit alternatives; neither starts automatically. With `SCRUMBOY_OIDC_LOCAL_AUTH_DISABLED=true`, the password form is omitted and **Continue with SSO** is the primary authentication action.
- The SSO action sends the complete current `/oauth/authorize?...` request as the OIDC login route's `return_to`. The existing OIDC sanitizer requires that continuation to remain an internal relative Scrumboy path. A client parameter also named `return_to` may remain inside the preserved authorize query, but `/oauth/authorize` does not use it for navigation and it cannot replace the server-constructed outer continuation.
- After successful SSO, the existing callback creates the session and returns to the full pending authorize request, which then renders consent. Failed or cancelled SSO keeps the existing internal `/?oidc_error=...` destination; restart the authorization request after a failure.
- Password accounts with 2FA complete the challenge inline on the same authorization page through the existing `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/login/2fa` APIs. The pending token remains only in page memory; successful verification reloads the authorize request into consent. **Start over** clears the challenge and restores password login, while hybrid deployments keep **Continue with SSO** available. Invalid, expired, and rate-limited attempts use fixed user-facing messages rather than raw API errors.
- Upstream human sign-in remains provider-neutral: Scrumboy uses standard OIDC discovery, authorization code flow, issuer validation, and `(issuer, subject)` identity binding. The upstream provider receives only Scrumboy's configured callback (for Vega, `https://<vega-host>/api/auth/oidc/callback`). Cursor and Claude redirect URIs are dynamically registered with Scrumboy's OAuth server and are not registered with the upstream provider.

**Consent**

- Single fixed scope ("read and manage projects, todos, sprints, and tags"); there is no granular per-scope consent screen.
- The user approving consent must have an authenticated Scrumboy session established through one of the methods above.
- Because `client_name` is unauthenticated, self-registered metadata (any client can call itself "Claude Code" or anything else), the consent screen also shows the actual `redirect_uri` destination the code will be sent to, not just the name, so a user has something to check before approving.
- The consent form POST requires `Origin` (falling back to `Referer`) to match this server's own origin, rejecting the request otherwise. `SameSite=Lax` on the session cookie alone isn't sufficient: "site" for SameSite purposes is the registrable domain, not this exact origin, so a form auto-submitted from any sibling subdomain sharing that cookie's Domain would otherwise still carry it into this endpoint. Classic HTML form navigations may omit `Origin`; OAuth HTML pages therefore send `Referrer-Policy: same-origin` so a same-origin Approve POST still includes `Referer` for that fallback, while cross-origin navigations (including to an MCP client's redirect URI or an IdP) withhold `Referer`. Missing both headers fails closed. Sibling-subdomain attackers still fail because their `Origin`/`Referer` host does not match this Scrumboy instance's canonical issuer.
- The login, consent, and error HTML pages all send `Cache-Control: no-store`, `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'none'`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`, and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, so the Approve button can't be framed for a clickjacking-style attack and a shared/cached browser never retains a copy of these pages.

**OAuth abuse resistance**

- OAuth uses dedicated in-process limiter buckets: `POST /oauth/register` allows **10 requests/minute/IP**, and `POST /oauth/token` allows **60 requests/minute/IP** for authorization-code exchanges and refresh rotation. Both use only the `ip:` + client-IP key. The existing authentication limiter remains **10 requests/minute** for its existing login, login/2FA, password-reset completion, and authenticated 2FA-management consumers; OAuth traffic does not spend that bucket. There are no limiter-tuning environment variables.
- OAuth IP keys honor `X-Forwarded-For` only when `SCRUMBOY_TRUST_PROXY=1`; otherwise they use `RemoteAddr` (see `SCRUMBOY_TRUST_PROXY` in the README), so a client cannot spoof a fresh bucket per request.
- `POST /oauth/register` requires `Content-Type: application/json` strictly, rejecting any other value. This isn't just input validation: a cross-origin browser request with e.g. `Content-Type: text/plain` is a CORS "simple request" that needs no preflight, so without this check a hostile webpage could get many unwitting visitors' browsers to each register a client from their own IP — defeating the per-IP rate limit above by distributing registration load across real, distinct addresses instead of one attacker IP.
- After trimming, `client_name` is limited to **128 Unicode code points** and the single redirect URI is limited to **2048 UTF-8 bytes**. An empty trimmed `client_name` remains valid and is displayed as “This application” during consent.
- `redirect_uris` must contain exactly one entry (extras are rejected, not silently dropped), which must be a well-formed absolute `http`/`https` URL with a valid host and optional numeric port in the range 1–65535, no userinfo, and no fragment delimiter. `https` is allowed for any host; plain `http` is allowed only for loopback (`localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1` — not RFC1918/LAN addresses), per RFC 8252, for native/CLI clients. This is a structural sanity check only — it does not make a registered client trustworthy; exact-match comparison against the registered value is still what prevents redirect-target tampering during the authorize/token flow.

**Mode**

- Available only in full mode (`SCRUMBOY_MODE=full`). All `/oauth/*` and `/.well-known/oauth-*` endpoints return `404` in anonymous mode.

**Issuer / discovery origin**

- <a name="issuer--discovery-origin"></a>**Issuer / discovery origin.** The `issuer`/`resource` values in the two discovery documents, and the absolute endpoint URLs built from them, are chosen in order: (1) `SCRUMBOY_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, when set and OAuth-safe — **HTTPS is required for any non-loopback OAuth issuer**; plain `http` is accepted only for an explicit loopback host (`localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`) as a local-dev exception. Password-reset link construction may still accept non-loopback `http` via the same env var; OAuth discovery will fail closed with `503` if that value is non-loopback HTTP. The inbound request is never consulted on this rung. (2) Direct TLS, where TLS supplies the `https` scheme and the request's `Host` is used only after strict authority and port validation (TLS encrypts the connection; it does not by itself authenticate the Host value). (3) When `SCRUMBOY_TRUST_PROXY=1`, a validated forwarded origin — exactly one `X-Forwarded-Proto` value of `https` (or, if that header is entirely absent, exactly one `CF-Visitor` with `"scheme":"https"`) **and** exactly one explicit, valid `X-Forwarded-Host`. (4) A validated loopback request host over plain `http`. The proxy branch never falls back to the backend-facing request `Host`. When `SCRUMBOY_TRUST_PROXY=1`, OAuth issuer discovery requires either `SCRUMBOY_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` or a proxy-provided `X-Forwarded-Host` together with a forwarded HTTPS indication. A proxy that sends only `X-Forwarded-Proto` (or multi-value / comma-separated forwarded scheme/host fields) receives `503 server_error`. Enable TrustProxy only behind a reverse proxy that **overwrites or strips client-supplied** values for every trusted forwarding header OAuth may use (`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, and `CF-Visitor` if used) — not only `X-Forwarded-For`. If no ladder branch applies, discovery fails closed with the same controlled 503 rather than guessing an issuer.

**Token lifetimes**

- Authorization codes: 60 seconds, single-use.
- Access tokens: 1 hour.
- Refresh tokens: 30 days (matches the existing session TTL), rotated on every use.
- Consumed/expired codes and revoked/expired tokens are swept hourly by the same background job that expires temporary boards (`DeleteExpiredOAuthArtifacts` in `cmd/scrumboy/main.go`) — nothing else deletes these rows, only marks them consumed/revoked.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp/rpc` | Canonical RFC 9728 metadata for `<origin>/mcp/rpc`. |
| `GET` | `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` | Compatibility metadata alias; returns the identical `/mcp/rpc` resource identity. |
| `GET` | `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | RFC 8414 — advertises the endpoints below. |
| `POST` | `/oauth/register` | RFC 7591 — self-service client registration. |
| `GET`/`POST` | `/oauth/authorize` | RFC 6749 §3.1 — login/consent, then issues an authorization code. |
| `POST` | `/oauth/token` | RFC 6749 §3.2 — exchanges a code or refresh token for an access token. |
| `POST` | `/oauth/revoke` | RFC 7009 — revokes an access or refresh token. |

`/oauth/*` is deliberately outside `/api/*`: it does not require the `X-Scrumboy: 1` CSRF header that `/api/*` writes require. The consent form at `/oauth/authorize` instead combines `SameSite=Lax` session-cookie semantics with a canonical `Origin` check (falling back to `Referer` when `Origin` is absent). A submission whose browser origin does not match the OAuth issuer is rejected. See the Consent section for why `Referrer-Policy: same-origin` is required for that fallback.

`/oauth/token` and `/oauth/revoke` accept OAuth parameters only in a POST body encoded as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (media-type parameters are allowed). Defined parameters in the query string, unsupported or malformed content types, and duplicate defined parameters are rejected with `invalid_request`; token `resource` cardinality and value errors retain `invalid_target`. Token endpoint responses, including errors, send `Cache-Control: no-store` and `Pragma: no-cache`.

## Example: token exchange

```sh
curl -X POST https://scrumboy.example.com/oauth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  --data-urlencode "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  --data-urlencode "code=$CODE" \
  --data-urlencode "redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URI" \
  --data-urlencode "client_id=$CLIENT_ID" \
  --data-urlencode "code_verifier=$CODE_VERIFIER" \
  --data-urlencode "resource=https://scrumboy.example.com/mcp/rpc"
```

```json
{
  "access_token": "...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "..."
}
```

Then use it exactly like a static API token:

```sh
curl -X POST https://scrumboy.example.com/mcp/rpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-11-25" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"projects_list","arguments":{}}}'
```

## Error Handling

`/oauth/token` and `/oauth/register` return the flat RFC 6749 §5.2 / RFC 7591 §3.2.2 error shape (not Scrumboy's usual `{"error":{"code":...}}` API envelope):

```json
{"error": "invalid_grant", "error_description": "the authorization code is invalid, expired, or already used"}
```

Codes used: **`invalid_request`**, **`invalid_client`**, **`invalid_grant`**, **`invalid_target`**, **`unsupported_grant_type`**, **`access_denied`**, **`unsupported_response_type`**, **`invalid_redirect_uri`**, **`invalid_client_metadata`**.

`/oauth/authorize` failures either redirect to the client's `redirect_uri` with `error`/`error_description`/`state` query params (once `redirect_uri` itself is verified against the registered client), or — if `redirect_uri` cannot be verified — render a plain error page instead of redirecting, to avoid an open-redirect.

For a well-formed form-body request, `/oauth/revoke` returns `200` whether or not the presented token existed (RFC 7009 §2.2). Malformed, query-supplied, or duplicate parameters return `invalid_request` without revoking a token. This preserves existence hiding without accepting credentials from URLs.

---

## Not Implemented

The following are explicitly out of scope in the current version:

- **Confidential clients / client secrets** — public clients (PKCE) only.
- **Multiple redirect URIs per client** — one per client, fixed at registration.
- **Granular per-scope consent** — a single fixed scope.
- **Refresh-token reuse-detection cascade** — a reused (already-rotated-away-from) refresh token is rejected, but reuse does not revoke the rest of that token family.
- **Revocation cascade** — explicitly revoking a refresh token via `/oauth/revoke` does not also revoke access tokens already issued alongside it; those remain valid until their own (1 hour) expiry. Access and refresh tokens aren't linked by a shared grant/family id in the current schema, so revoking one can't look up the other.
- **Admin UI for listing/revoking registered OAuth clients** — inspect or clean up via direct database access if ever needed.
- **JWT access tokens / JWKS endpoint** — tokens are opaque and validated by direct database lookup, matching how static API tokens already work.
